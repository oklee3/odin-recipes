    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p> A korean dish enjoyed by many thanks to its combination of cheap ingredients, easy preperation,
        and incredible flavor. There are many variations, but I have included my personal recipe involving
        a seemingly non-Korean ingredient, Spam. Spam is actually a huge part of Korean street cuisine, as
        it was something in abundance during the war that Korean families had to figure out how to 
        incorporate into their meals. This kimchi fried rice is a perfect example of how Spam integrated 
        into Korean cuisine, blending with onions and kimchi to create a delicious meal. The fried egg on
        top is an absolute must.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 can Spam, diced</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup kimchi, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp kimchi juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tbsp seasame oil</li>
        <li>3-4 scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp seasame seeds</li>
        <li>1 fried egg per serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In large skillet over medium-high heat, cook Spam 3-5 min, until lightly browned. Remove from skillet.</li>
        <li>In same skillet, heat vegetable oil. Add kimchi, rice, water, kimchi juice, gochujang. Stir-fry 5-7 min.</li>
        <li>Add seasame oil and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on seasame seeds and scallions, serve with a fried egg.</li>
    </ol>
