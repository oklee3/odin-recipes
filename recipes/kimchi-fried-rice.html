    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p> A korean dish enjoyed by many thanks to its combination of cheap ingredients, easy preperation,
        and incredible flavor. There are many variations, but I have included my personal recipe involving
        a seemingly non-Korean ingredient, Spam. Spam is actually a huge part of Korean street cuisine, as
        it was something in abundance during the war that Korean families had to figure out how to 
        incorporate into their meals. This kimchi fried rice is a perfect example of how Spam integrated 
        into Korean cuisine, blending with onions and kimchi to create a delicious meal. The fried egg on
        top is an absolute must.</p>
