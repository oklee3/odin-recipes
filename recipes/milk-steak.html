    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p> Famously introduced to the world by Charlie Kelly in "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia", the milk steak is 
        a delicacy consisting of a steak boiled in milk. There are many variations on the milk steak, though traditionally
        it is boiled over hard and served with a garnish of high-end jelly beans. This recipe attempts to recreate 
        the milk steak as Mr. Kelly himself envisioned it: an elevated dish that is as much an art form as it is a meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium 8.8oz flat iron steak</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup jelly beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Heat until honey has dissolved completely.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then carefully add the steak.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, cooking the steak for 5 min on each side</li>
        <li>Remove the steak and check the temperature. We are looking for a steak boiled over hard, meaning there should be 
            no pink showing. If underdone, stick back in the simmering milk for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Allow the steak to rest, then serve with a garnish of jelly beans.</li>
    </ol>
